[We can handle multiple windows or tabs of browser by using 
getWindowHandles() method


getWindowHandle() : gets the windowid/WindowHande of current focused window
return type is String

getWindowHandles(): gets all the windowsid's/WindowHandles of the windows which are opened at that current instance, return type is set<String>

List: Values are stored in index wise and duplicate values are allowed
- always index starts with Zero.

Set: duplicate values are not allowed 

driver.close() : This method will close the current focused window and driver memory will not be destroyed i.e., driver will not become null

driver.quit() : This method will close all the browser windows which are opend at that instance and driver object will become null


Handling Popups/Alerts:
--------------------------------
Alert : Alert is an Interface used to handle alerts or popups

driver.switchTo().alert().accept() //to click accept or OK button on alert

driver .switchTo().alert().dismiss() // to click cncel or reject button on alert

driver.switchTo().alert().getText() // to get the Text on the alert window

driver.switchTo().alert().sendKeys() // to Send the text on the alert window


Actions : Actions is  a class used to handle mouse actions or events

Actions act = new Actions(driver);
act.sendKeys("text").build().perform();
act.click().build().perform();
act.moveToElement(WebElement).build().perform();


Batch or Suite Execution: Execution of two or more test cases together is called batch/suite execution.
In TestNG we can execute batch executions by using testNG XML file (TestNGSuiteXML.file)

Advantages of TestNG:
- Execution flows based on the annotations
- suite execution by using XML file
- Clear Test Reports
- we can prioritize our test executions by passing parameters priroity
- we can enable or disable the @test methods 
- we can groupby @test methods
- data provider annoatation is used to provide multiple sets of data to the @Test methods
- We can excute tests in Parallel by setting up parallel parametet is equls to true in testNG.XML file



@DataProvider: is used to provide multiple sets of data to the @Test annotation methods, return type is Object Array
